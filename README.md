# Othello

Implementation of the game Othello/Reversi using the minimax algorithm to allow
the player to play against an AI opponent. 

The player is able to choose by three different levels of difficulty which decides 
which heuristic the minimax algorithm will use for evaluation.

Currently only playable on an ASCII board in terminal/IDE but will evetually add GUI.

Done as a project in the course Algorithm and Data structures at my university.
